# Integrated Project 1
Online store Ice sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources.
The project is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow spotting potential big winners and planning advertising campaigns.
